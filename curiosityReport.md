# Accessibility Testing Curiosity Report

## Why I chose Accessibility
I had actually heard about Accessibility Testing from a meeting I had from my Web Developer job, but I had never tried it out before. After some quick research, it looked quite simple and I wanted to try it out for myself.

## Accessibility Overview
Accessibility in software refers to designing and testing applications so that all people, including those with disabilities, can use them effectively. The goal is to ensure that digital products are perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for everyone. Accessibility is guided by standards which outline best practices for creating inclusive experiences, the most popular in North America being the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

In development and DevOps pipelines, accessibility testing checks whether an application meets these standards and works correctly with assistive technologies such as screen readers, keyboard navigation, and voice control. Automating accessibility checks early in the pipeline helps teams catch issues before deployment, reduce remediation costs, and deliver more inclusive software.

### Key Points of Accessibility
- Ensures software can be used by people with disabilities  
- Follows standards like WCAG to guide design and testing  
- Often integrates with DevOps pipelines for automated testing  
- Improves usability, legal compliance, and overall user experience  

## My Experiment
I generated a lighthouse report from Google Chrome's developer tools on my JWT website to get an accessibility score. When it analyzed the page for me, it gave me a score of 80, suggesting that I needed to add accessible names to buttons, have alt attributes for image elements, and add descernible names to certain links. It also suggested that the background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio.

## Example Use Case
You can also automatically test this when deploying your code by adding the Lighthouse accessibility test to your CI/CD Pipeline. Here is an example generated by ChatGPT:

```
name: Lighthouse CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  lighthouse:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install Lighthouse CI
        run: npm install -g @lhci/cli

      - name: Run Lighthouse CI
        run: |
          lhci autorun \
            --collect.url="https://yourwebsite.com" \
            --upload.target=filesystem \
            --assert.preset=lighthouse:recommended
```

## Conclusion/Final Thoughts
I really enjoyed looking into this subject! It's a good tool to help me improve my product with things I wouldn't have considered before. I now understand the importance of accessibility and allowing my applications to be able to work for everyone's needs. It's very easy to apply to my pipeline, yet crucial to have in order to make my application accessible to everyone.
